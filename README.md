# Look4Book

Look4Book is a second hand book selling web based platform. 

### Problem Statement
People prefer buying used books as they are cheap and majorly solve the same purpose as compared to new books. It is difficult to locate nearby local vendors that buy and sell used books. There is a need to build a robust application that provides a platform for us to locate the nearby vendors that sell the desired used book and the price they are offering. Also, we can find vendors that buy used books so that students can sell books that are of no use to them.
